<p><em><strong>Documentation Tab</strong></em></p>
<p>The Documentation Tab will work for you as a tutorial. If you have any problems or need help using BEAT, this tab will let you search any tab or BEAT-related details such as creating a customized plugin. By scrolling down or up within the tab window or typing key words inside the search bar which is identified by the magnifying glass on the left-hand side, you can search for a specific topic from the available list.</p>
