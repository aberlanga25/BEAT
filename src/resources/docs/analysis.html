<p><em><strong>Analysis Tab</strong></em></p>
<p>The analysis tab is the main hub of work of BEAT. Here is where the user does static and dynamic analysis for the selected project. To perform any type of analysis, we require to have a plugin always selected and have a valid project selected.</p>
<p>When a user gets its plugin and project file selected, it is required to perform static analysis. after static analysis is completed then the Analyst will be allowed to perform dynamic analysis. The dynamic analysis will allow to perform runs of the system with custom input if the file allows it. A dynamic analysis can store different runs every time you run a new dynamic analysis. This allows the system to have different results. The results could be used to generate outputs using the outputs.</p>
<p>Every single POI (Point of Interest) will be allowed to be clicked and showed on the “Detailed Point of Interest View”. The text area is located on the right side of the window. When selecting a POI, the text area will display a list of all the attributes on the point of interest will be shown for the analyst to further inspection. An option to add a comment is also available for each of the POIs found.</p>
