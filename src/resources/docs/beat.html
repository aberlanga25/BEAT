<p><em><strong>B.E.A.T (Behavioral Extraction and Analysis Tool)</strong></em></p>
<p>BEAT is a software designed to aid analysts by pseudo-automatically uncovering certain behaviors and structures from binary files. BEAT will start by statically collecting information in the binary. The resulting information will be provided to you, who will then refine the analysis and have the option to conduct a dynamic analysis by specifying points of interest. The result will be a set of identified message structures including field data types, default values, names, and dependencies among other fields in the same message. Then, you will be able to make modifications and adjustments through the graphical interface. Finally, BEAT, aided by the plugin, will be able to generate code extracted from the binary file.</p>
